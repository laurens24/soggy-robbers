Info 201 group project

This application analyzes crime and precipitation data in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Boston from January 1, 2016, to February 8, 2018. It looks at violent and nonviolent crimes and attempts to answer 2 questions:

#### Is there a correlation between precipitation levels and crime activity in Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Chicago?
#### Is there a trend that emerges when looking at only violent or non-violent crimes?

For each city we have included sidebars to filter precipitation levels and the type of crime (violent, nonviolent, or both) and tabs that display a bar chart comparing precipitation data and average crimes and maps of each city with 200 crimes selected from the user-filtered data. The maps are interactive and allow the user to view which specific crimes occurred. The maps also provide zoom functionality to get an overall view of popular crime locations in each city.

Datasets used are from climate.gov and from crime data APIs for each city, respectively.

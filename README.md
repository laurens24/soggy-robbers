##Analysis Questions

###Is there a correlation between precipitation levels and crime activity in Seattle, San Francisco, Chicago, NYC, Boston and Los Angeles?
Maybe crimes are less likely to happen on days with rain, or maybe they’re more likely to occur on rainy days. The answer could provide an interesting insight into what a day with high likelihood of crime occuring might be.

###How are these correlations similar / different?
If the cities all share the same relationship between rain and crime, then these results are much easier to extrapolate beyond the locations we analysed. If the data varies from city to city, it could indicate that there is a different variable affecting the data.

###Is there a trend that emerges when only looking at only violent or non-violent crimes?
The comparison of crimes and rain could potentially expose trends if we limit the data to violent or non-violent crimes. Maybe violent crime occurrences are not affected much by rain while non-violent crimes display a strong connection.

###What percentage of total crimes occur seasonally and how do they compare between major cities across the US?
An interesting analysis would be to partition the dates into seasons or other groups and discover if certain parts of the year have a noticeable increase in crime occurrences. Potentially the data could be analysed and partition itself into times of the year when crime is high and times when crime is low.

###How does this rain-based crime-rate compare with the city’s overall crime-rate?
Using the frequency of crimes committed in rainy or sunny weather, the crime-rate for that weather can be compared to the city’s crime-rate to establish any deviation this specific data has from the city’s overall trend.
